      New York, NY — Latino people in New York City had the highest rate of unintentional drug overdoses compared to Black and white people in 2019, according to the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Bureau of Vital Statistics. In Brooklyn, Latino residents had the highest rate of drug overdose deaths in the neighborhood, compared to other groups of residents, with 83 deaths—and yet, Latinos only make up 19% of the population of Brooklyn.

      Earlier this month, Governor Hochul passed legislation to curb unintentional drug overdoses in the state. It’s not the first time that New York has tried to tackle the issue. In 2017, a 60 million dollar citywide program was followed by a decrease in overall drug overdoses in New York City—but deaths continued to rise for latino people. Will this new legislation be able to make a difference among latino people?

      In 2017, mayor Bill De Blasio, launched Healing NYC, which provided educational outreach, distribution of naloxone kits, it trained professionals to treat opioid addiction, and funded syringe exchange programs. Subsequently, the Health Department of NYC announced the first decrease in citywide drug overdose deaths in 2018—a first in eight years. And yet, as the citywide number of overdoses decreased, and the number decreased for white and Black people (5% and 13% respectively), the rate of overdoses in Latino people increased by 5% and is still on the rise.

      Clinical Psychologist, Nicole Hollingshead, who has written about pain management in latino populations, explained over email that this discrepancy might be due to several factors: “Latino patients may not feel comfortable seeking addiction mental health care due to stigma. In general, Latino patients seek pain management less than their Non-Hispanic White counterparts, so the Latino population may be even less likely to seek addiction/mental health services.” The reason, she notes, might also fall with health providers who “may also be less likely to suspect addiction issues or mental health concerns in Latino patients based on provider bias that these issues are not as prevalent in the Latino population or believe that Latino patients would not be interested in seeking services, thus they do not refer.”

      The NYC Department of Health published its first study dedicated to the health of Latino people in the city in 2017. It noted that among all Latino people that died of drug overdoses in 2015, almost two thirds were from Puerto Rico. Latino people born in the United States were also five times more likely to die of an overdose than those born in another country. The study did not explain what factors contribute to these findings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hollingshead mentions that “Latinos are less likely to have health insurance relative to any other racial/ethnic group” which might lead them to not have access to treatment, or believe that they cannot access treatment. These are all issues that Latino people in NYC still face today, as the governor’s new legislation packet begins to roll out.

      The new state legislation promises many initiatives to combat unintentional drug overdoses. On the one hand, it decriminalizes the possession of opioid antagonists, such as naltrexone which can be used as treatment, and naloxone which can be used in life threatening situations. A program will also be created so that these treatments are available within jails. A public directory will be published which lists all of the centers where one can obtain opioid antagonists publicly. Finally, judges will be able to send people who are experiencing addiction, to rehabilitation instead of jail, for certain crimes.

      Garret Reuscher, a harm reduction psychotherapist and Bushwick resident, explains over a phone interview, that one of the major problems with the illegal sale of drugs today, is that the quality of the drugs is not regulated. He notes that this issue has only been further heightened by the pandemic: “We’re seeing more fentanyl, more contaminated substances because the supply chain has been disrupted.” The new state legislation is up against a particular moment in the history of drug overdoses in NYC because of the supply chain issue. Right now the timeline for the legislation’s promised changes is not yet known.
