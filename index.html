      New York, NY — Latino people in New York City had the highest rate of unintentional drug overdoses compared to Black and white people in 2019, according to the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Bureau of Vital Statistics. In Brooklyn, for example, Latino residents had the highest rate of drug overdose deaths in the neighborhood with 83 deaths—and yet, Latinos only make up 19% of the population of Brooklyn. Earlier this month, Governor Hochul passed legislation to curb unintentional drug overdoses in the state. Will this new legislation make an impact on the rising overdose death rate among Latino people in New York City?

      In 2017, mayor Bill De Blasio, launched Healing NYC, a 60 million dollar program which provided educational outreach, distribution of naloxone kits, it trained professionals to treat opioid addiction, and funded syringe exchange programs. Subsequently, the Health Department of the city announced the first decrease in citywide drug overdose deaths in 2018—a first in eight years. And yet, as the citywide number of overdoses decreased, and the number decreased for white and Black people (5% and 13% respectively), the rate of overdoses in Latino people increased by 5% and is still on the rise.

      Clinical Psychologist, Nicole Hollingshead, explained over email that this might be due to several factors: “Latino patients may not feel comfortable seeking addiction mental health care due to stigma. In general, Latino patients seek pain management less than their Non-Hispanic White counterparts, so the Latino population may be even less likely to seek addiction/mental health services.” The reason, she notes, might also fall with health providers who “may also be less likely to suspect addiction issues or mental health concerns in Latino patients based on provider bias that these issues are not as prevalent in the Latino population or believe that Latino patients would not be interested in seeking services, thus they do not refer.”

      Hollingshead mentioned that “Latinos are less likely to have health insurance relative to any other racial/ethnic group,” which might lead them to not have access to treatment, or believe that they cannot access treatment. These are all issues that Latino people in NYC still face today, as the governor’s new legislation packet begins to roll out.
